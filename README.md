# odin-recipes
HTML Foundations project

The purpose of this project is to practice the skills learned 
in the HTML Foundations course of The Odin Project.
The tasks are as follows:

- Create an HTML file with a header reading "Odin Recipes"
- Create a subdirectory and an HTML file within it
- Populate the new HTML file with the name of my favorite meal
- Link the recipe to the main HTML file
- Add an image of the finished meal to the recipe HTML page
- Add a description of the dish below the image
- Add an unordered list of all the ingredients needed
- Add an ordered list detailing each step for making the dish
- Create two more recipes following an identical page structure

By the end of this project, I will show I have learned the 
basics needed to create an HTML project with lists, links, and images.
